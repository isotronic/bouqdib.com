This is the repository for my personal website.

## About

My personal website is built on Gatsby using TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. Feel free to use this repo as a starting point for your own project.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: For static typing and better code quality.
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components with utility-first CSS.
